## Norsonic Data Converter
The Norsonic Data Converter streamlines the process of converting and managing acoustic measurement files for engineers.
After extracting XLSX files using the NorXFer software (by Norsonic), this application allows users to convert and concatenate the data into a CSV format compatible with the dBtrait software (by ACOEM).

### Key Features

**Data Upload**:

The app supports Norsonic data files in the format NORXXX_XXXXXXXX_XXXX_PROFILE.xlsx. Files can be uploaded by dragging and dropping or through browsing, with a maximum size of 5MB.

**Frequency Bands Selection**: 

Users can choose the minimum and maximum frequency bands for analysis, giving flexibility in the data range used for conversion.

**File Result Format**: 

Users can select between generating separate files or a concatenated file for the final output.

**Data Conversion**: 

Once the required parameters are set, clicking “Convert” processes the uploaded data and generates the necessary output files.

**File Management**: 

The app provides a table displaying uploaded files with options to delete or clear them before and after processing.
