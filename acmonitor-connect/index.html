<h2 id="introduction-to-acmonitor-connect">Introduction to Acmonitor Connect</h2>
<p>Acmonitor Connect is a dedicated workspace focused on acoustic measurements and their subsequent analysis. Initially developed as an IoT (Internet of Things) platform, it displayed real-time acoustic measurements from connected devices. The workspace has since evolved to facilitate advanced analysis calculations, not just on data from IoT devices received through MQTT, but also on datasets uploaded by the user.</p>
<h2 id="device-data">Device Data</h2>
<p>In this application, users can request and view real-time measurements from connected acoustic monitoring systems. This functionality is essential for those who need immediate and live data to make informed decisions on-the-spot.
The Device Data application allows users to request real-time measurements from connected acoustic monitoring systems.   </p>
<p>Below is a step-by-step guide on how to use this feature:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Select a Device</strong>: Click the orange "Select device" button located at the top left corner of the page to choose the device you want to query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose a Time-zone</strong>: As all data are stored in UTC, users must select their time-zone to convert the request date and time. Currently, only UTC, UTC+1, and UTC+2 are available options for conversion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Select Date and Time Range</strong>: Choose the start date and time as well as the end date and time, factoring in your chosen time-zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pick an Acoustic Parameter</strong>: Our monitoring stations can measure multiple parameters. Users need to select the specific parameter they are interested in viewing. Note that the availability of certain parameters depends on the station's configuration, but LAeq is always an available option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Run the Request</strong>: Upon completing the previous steps, run the request. If data can be located, a time-series graph should appear on the screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Download Data</strong>: Users have the option to download the displayed data by clicking on the "Download" button. The data will be downloaded as a CSV file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>View Battery Data</strong>: Navigate to another tab within the application to check the battery status of the selected monitoring station.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Erase and Restart</strong>: To initiate a new data request, the existing graph must be erased. Navigate back to the main screen and start a new query following steps 1 to 7.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, users can effectively query, view, and download real-time acoustic data from connected monitoring systems.</p>
<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>Project is a versatile application designed to streamline project management and data visualization. It facilitates 
the creation and management of acoustic projects, offering tools to input and edit essential project details such 
as names, descriptions, geographical data, and images. Users can also manage measurement devices crucial for data 
collection, view detailed device data, and download this data in a user-friendly CSV format. The app integrates map 
views for a spatial understanding of projects and devices, enhancing the interactive experience by displaying project 
details and device statuses directly on the map. With robust user management capabilities, "Project" ensures secure 
and role-specific access, allowing project owners to control data visibility and modification permissions effectively.</p>

<h2 id="wind-farm-analysis">Wind Farm Analysis</h2>
<p>The Wind Farm Analysis application is designed to offer comprehensive analysis based on acoustic and meteorological measurements. It allows users to conduct in-depth studies on wind farm noise impacts, utilizing either real-time data or historical datasets. The application is divided into two primary views:</p>
<h3 id="dataset-view">Dataset view</h3>
<p>This view offers data visualizations based on the datasets selected for analysis.</p>
<p>Data Sources: A dataset is composed of two sources: the acoustic source and the meteorological source.
- Acoustic Source: Provided by Acmonitor stations, which gather acoustic data and store them in our cloud as IoT devices. These are directly accessible within the platform.
- Meteorological Source: Provided by the user in the form of a CSV file through the Upload Data section. The file should contain time series data on wind velocity, wind direction, temperature, humidity, and wind farm operating modes.</p>
<p>Creating a New Analysis: By clicking the "Analysis" button, users can select their two data sources for analysis. Data sources can later be updated using the "Data Source" button.</p>
<p>Filters: The "Filter" button allows users to refine the dataset based on specific criteria such as time period, acoustic levels, wind velocity, wind direction, and rain.</p>
<h3 id="analysis-view">Analysis View</h3>
<p>Calculations: This view initiates the calculations based on the French standard analysis described in the acoustic measurement protocol of June 2023.</p>
<p>Results: Users can access visualizations and compliance results related to the measurements.</p>
<h2 id="upload-data">Upload Data</h2>
<p>The Upload Data application is a utility tool designed to enable users to upload their acoustic and meteorological datasets. These datasets can then be used for analysis in the 'Wind Farm Analysis' application, providing a seamless and integrated experience. The Upload Data application has recently been updated with several new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data Archiving: Users can archive their upload data by downloading template files. This makes it easier to maintain and manage multiple datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wind Data Standardization: During the upload process, users have the option to indicate whether their wind data is already standardized. If Yes: No additional action is needed. If No: Users can provide the height of the measurement point, and the code will automatically standardize the data for the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud Storage: All uploaded datasets are securely stored on the cloud and are accessible to the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Management: Users can manage their stored datasets directly within the Upload Data application. This includes the ability to remove datasets if they are no longer needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
