Wind Farm Analysis The Wind Farm Analysis application is designed to offer comprehensive analysis based on acoustic and meteorological measurements. It allows users to conduct in-depth studies on wind farm noise impacts, utilizing either real-time data or historical datasets. The application is divided into two primary views: Dataset view This view offers data visualizations based on the datasets selected for analysis. Data Sources: A dataset is composed of two sources: the acoustic source and the meteorological source. - Acoustic Source: Provided by Acmonitor stations, which gather acoustic data and store them in our cloud as IoT devices. These are directly accessible within the platform. - Meteorological Source: Provided by the user in the form of a CSV file through the Upload Data section. The file should contain time series data on wind velocity, wind direction, temperature, humidity, and wind farm operating modes. Creating a New Analysis: By clicking the \"Analysis\" button, users can select their two data sources for analysis. Data sources can later be updated using the \"Data Source\" button. Filters: The \"Filter\" button allows users to refine the dataset based on specific criteria such as time period, acoustic levels, wind velocity, wind direction, and rain. Analysis View Calculations: This view initiates the calculations based on the French standard analysis described in the acoustic measurement protocol of June 2023. Results: Users can access visualizations and compliance results related to the measurements. Upload Data The Upload Data application is a utility tool designed to enable users to upload their acoustic and meteorological datasets. These datasets can then be used for analysis in the 'Wind Farm Analysis' application, providing a seamless and integrated experience. The Upload Data application has recently been updated with several new features: Data Archiving: Users can archive their upload data by downloading template files. This makes it easier to maintain and manage multiple datasets. Wind Data Standardization: During the upload process, users have the option to indicate whether their wind data is already standardized. If Yes: No additional action is needed. If No: Users can provide the height of the measurement point, and the code will automatically standardize the data for the user. Cloud Storage: All uploaded datasets are securely stored on the cloud and are accessible to the user. Data Management: Users can manage their stored datasets directly within the Upload Data application. This includes the ability to remove datasets if they are no longer needed. Toolbox Norsonic Data Converter The Norsonic Data Converter streamlines the process of converting and managing acoustic measurement files for engineers. After extracting XLSX files using the NorXFer software (by Norsonic), this application allows users to convert and concatenate the data into a CSV format compatible with the dBtrait software (by ACOEM). Key Features Data Upload : The app supports Norsonic data files in the format NORXXX_XXXXXXXX_XXXX_PROFILE.xlsx. Files can be uploaded by dragging and dropping or through browsing, with a maximum size of 5MB. Frequency Bands Selection : Users can choose the minimum and maximum frequency bands for analysis, giving flexibility in the data range used for conversion. File Result Format : Users can select between generating separate files or a concatenated file for the final output.

Data Sources: A dataset is composed of two sources: the acoustic source and the meteorological source. - Acoustic Source: Provided by Acmonitor stations, which gather acoustic data and store them in our cloud as IoT devices. These are directly accessible within the platform. - Meteorological Source: Provided by the user in the form of a CSV file through the Upload Data section. The file should contain time series data on wind velocity, wind direction, temperature, humidity, and wind farm operating modes. Creating a New Analysis: By clicking the \"Analysis\" button, users can select their two data sources for analysis. Data sources can later be updated using the \"Data Source\" button. Filters: The \"Filter\" button allows users to refine the dataset based on specific criteria such as time period, acoustic levels, wind velocity, wind direction, and rain.","title":"Dataset view"},{"location":"workspaces/#analysis-view","text":"Calculations: This view initiates the calculations based on the French standard analysis described in the acoustic measurement protocol of June 2023.

These datasets can then be used for analysis in the 'Wind Farm Analysis' application, providing a seamless and integrated experience. The Upload Data application has recently been updated with several new features: Data Archiving: Users can archive their upload data by downloading template files. This makes it easier to maintain and manage multiple datasets. Wind Data Standardization: During the upload process, users have the option to indicate whether their wind data is already standardized. If Yes: No additional action is needed. If No: Users can provide the height of the measurement point, and the code will automatically standardize the data for the user. Cloud Storage: All uploaded datasets are securely stored on the cloud and are accessible to the user. Data Management: Users can manage their stored datasets directly within the Upload Data application. This includes the ability to remove datasets if they are no longer needed.","title":"Upload Data"},{"location":"workspaces/#toolbox","text":"","title":"Toolbox"},{"location":"workspaces/#norsonic-data-converter","text":"The Norsonic Data Converter streamlines the process of converting and managing acoustic measurement files for engineers.
